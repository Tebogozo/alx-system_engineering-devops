This project is focused on learning and understanding various concepts related to the Shell, I/O Redirection, Special Characters, and Other Man Pages. It covers topics such as command usage (e.g., head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, tr), file manipulation, redirection of input/output, combining commands with filters, and the usage of special characters in the Shell. The project also explores the purpose and format of specific files like /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.
